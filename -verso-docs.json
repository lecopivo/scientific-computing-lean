 "<code class=\"docstring\">The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal target or\nnon-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants:\n- `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`.\n- `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged\n  with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where the `hᵢ`'s are expressions.-\n- If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then `f` is unfolded. If `f` has equational lemmas associated\n  with it (and is not a projection or a `reducible` definition), these are used to rewrite with `f`.\n- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the\n  attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.\n- `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but does not use `[simp]` lemmas.\n- `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged\n  with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named `idᵢ`.\n- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If\n  the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis\n  `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.\n- `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.\n- `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses using the\n  other hypotheses.\n</code>",

 "<code>Eq.{u_1} {α : Sort u_1} : α → α → Prop</code><span class=\"sep\"></span><code class=\"docstring\">The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.\nWe use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.\nA fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.\n```\nvariable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)\nvariable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)\n\nexample : a = d :=\n  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd\n```\nEquality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion\nrespects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.\nThat is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.\nExample:\n```\nexample (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)\n        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=\n  Eq.subst h1 h2\n\nexample (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)\n    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=\n  h1 ▸ h2\n```\nThe triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\\t`.\nFor more information: [Equality](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/quantifiers_and_equality.html#equality)\n</code>",

It is defined as an\ninductive type freely generated by \"zero is a natural number\" and\n\"the successor of a natural number is a natural number\".\n\nYou can prove a theorem `P n` about `n : Nat` by `induction n`, which will\nexpect a proof of the theorem for `P 0`, and a proof of `P (succ i)` assuming\na proof of `P i`. The same method also works to define functions by recursion\non natural numbers: induction and recursion are two expressions of the same\noperation from Lean's point of view.\n\n```\nopen Nat\nexample (n : Nat) : n &lt; succ n := by\n  induction n with\n  | zero =&gt;\n    show 0 &lt; 1\n    decide\n  | succ i ih =&gt; -- ih : i &lt; succ i\n    show succ i &lt; succ (succ i)\n    exact Nat.succ_lt_succ ih\n```\n\nThis type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler:\n* The type of expressions contains \"`Nat` literals\" as a primitive constructor,\n  and the kernel knows how to reduce zero/succ expressions to nat literals.\n* If implemented naively, this type would represent a numeral `n` in unary as a\n  linked list with `n` links, which is horribly inefficient. Instead, the\n  runtime itself has a special representation for `Nat` which stores numbers up\n  to 2^63 directly and larger numbers use an arbitrary precision \"bignum\"\n  library (usually [GMP](https://gmplib.org/)).\n</code>"}
